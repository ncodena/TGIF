# TGIF

Development of a follow-up website for the US Congress for Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit organization working to increase the public’s involvement in government. 
The main purpose is displaying live data from the ProPublica Congress API on five HTML pages: Home page, two pages to display the lists of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives and two more to show statistics tables to track the activity of every chamber.

MAIN GOALS:

*Obtaining API key for the ProPublica Congress API to get JSON objects that contain the data of the two chambers of Congress.

*Creation of HTML pages that use JavaScript to display the data.

*Add filters to search data by the three parties and by state.

*Calculate the statistics and algorithms in Javascript.

*Follow style design requirements by using Bootstrap

TECHNOLOGIES:

*JavaScript

*AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to communicate directly with web services from a web page JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

*RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Application Program Interfaces) to standardize the messages used to get JSON objects with AJAX calls.

*Bootstrap, the world’s most popular front-end component library.
